Some files I find useful for coding on a small unix-based laptops. Most are self-explanatory.

## helpfiles ##
These are cheat-sheets for when I forget commands, which is a lot. I set .bash\_aliases so that $name-of-helpfile brings up the cheat-sheet.

## gnome-terminal ##
Has a custom color scheme that I like more than the default, and maps ctrl-[left/right arrow] to switch-to-prev/next-tab.

## .vim ##
Contains color schemes and various plugins. I use pathogen.
