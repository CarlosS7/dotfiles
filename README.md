Some files I find useful for coding on a small-screen laptop (Thinkpad X220) running Ubuntu 12.04 and gnome-terminal. Most are self-explanatory. 

## helpfiles ##
These are cheat-sheets for when I forget commands, which is a lot. I set .bash\_aliases so that $name-of-helpfile brings up the cheat-sheet.

## gnome-terminal ##
Has a custom color scheme that I like more than the default, and maps ctrl-[left/right arrow] to switch-to-prev/next-tab. 

## .vim ##
Contains:
* pathogen: makes it easier to install vim plugins by just cloning them from git.
* molokai: a color scheme.
* delimitMate: autocomplete delimiters (braces, quotes, etc.)
* python mode: lots of useful stuff for writing python
* vim-fugitive: access git commands from inside vim
